## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

The code is written using Pythons version 3.11.0. All libraries are available within the Anaconda distribution of Python.

## Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>

In this project I used the airbnb Seattle dataset to find out, how prices are set in relation to accomodation characteristics and over time.
To step into, I analyzed the market of airbnb listings in 2016 according to serveral characteristics, like room type, number of bedrooms, location and reviews.
I then wanted to find out how these characteristics are related to the prices and finally how prices change over time. 

My research question therefore are:
1. What are typical characteristics and locations of airbnb accommodations in Seattle?  
2. How are the rental prices related to accommodation characteristics?
3. How do rental prices change over time?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

My exploratory work on the airbnb dataset is shown and described in detail in the file airbnb_seattle_notebook.ipynb
I described my way of steping through the data in markdown along with code in Python and charts that visualize my findings.  

## Results <a name="results"></a>

The results of my analysis are summarized on my personal blog on [breuerei.de](https://breuerei.de/understanding-airbnb-prices-insights-for-your-next-trip).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements <a name="licensing"></a>
